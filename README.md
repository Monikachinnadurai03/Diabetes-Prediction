# Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes prediction in Python: Develop a machine learning model using factors like age, BMI, etc., to forecast diabetes risk. Train, evaluate the model, then deploy for proactive health management.

Diabetes prediction using Python involves building a machine learning model that forecasts whether an individual is likely to develop diabetes. By analyzing factors like age, BMI, blood pressure, and more, the model learns patterns from historical data to make accurate predictions about future instances. After training and evaluation, the model can be deployed to provide early risk assessment, aiding in proactive healthcare management.
